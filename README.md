# PIDController_Sim

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for experimenting and learning about PID Controllers in Python. 

I recommend having Anaconda installed on your machine, and using conda to manage your Python environments and packages. 

You can learn more about Anaconda and Jupyter by taking a look at a couple of these intro videos from Udacity:

For those of you without the time to setup  your machine for all of this, you can instead just take a glimpse from 
the html file that's included in this directory. Open it with your preferred browser.
